{CHAPTER I}

A THRALL OF THRALLS.

\textsc{In} the troubled twilight of a March evening ten years ago, an
old man, whose equipment and bearing suggested that he was fresh from
travel, walked slowly across Clerkenwell Green, and by the graveyard of
St. James's Church stood for a moment looking about him. His age could
not be far from seventy, but, despite the stoop of his shoulders, he
gave little sign of failing under the burden of years; his sober step
indicated gravity of character rather than bodily feebleness, and his
grasp of a stout stick was not such as bespeaks need of support. His
attire was neither that of a man of leisure, nor of the kind usually
worn by English {\protect\hypertarget{2}{}{}}mechanics. Instead of coat
and waistcoat, he wore a garment something like a fisherman's guernsey,
and over this a coarse short cloak, picturesque in appearance as it was
buffeted by the wind. His trousers were of moleskin; his boots reached
almost to his knees; for head-covering he had the cheapest kind of
undyed felt, its form exactly that of the old petasus. To say that his
aspect was venerable would serve to present him in a measure, yet would
not be wholly accurate, for there was too much of past struggle and
present anxiety in his countenance to permit full expression of the
natural dignity of the features. It was a fine face, and might have been
distinctly noble, but circumstances had marred the purpose of Nature;
you perceived that his cares had too often been of the kind which are
created by ignoble necessities, such as leave to most men of his
standing a bare humanity of visage. He had long thin white hair; his
beard was short and merely grizzled. In his left hand he carried a
bundle, which probably contained clothing.

{\protect\hypertarget{3}{}{}}The burial-ground by which he had paused
was as little restful to the eye as are most of those discoverable in
the byways of London. The small trees that grew about it shivered in
their leaflessness; the rank grass was wan under the failing day; most
of the stones leaned this way or that, emblems of neglect, (they were
very white at the top, and darkened downwards till the damp soil made
them black), and certain cats and dogs were prowling or sporting among
the graves. At this corner the east wind blew with malice such as it
never puts forth save where there are poorly clad people to be pierced;
it swept before it thin clouds of unsavoury dust, mingled with the light
refuse of the streets. Above the shapeless houses night was signalling a
murky approach; the sky---if sky it could be called---gave threatening
of sleet, perchance of snow. And on every side was the rumble of
traffic, the voiceful evidence of toil and of poverty; hawkers were
crying their goods; the inevitable organ was clanging before a
public-house hard by; {\protect\hypertarget{4}{}{}}the crumpet-man was
hastening along, with monotonous ringing of his bell and hoarse rhythmic
wail.

The old man had fixed his eyes half absently on the inscription of a
gravestone near him; a lean cat springing out between the iron railings
seemed to recall his attention, and with a slight sigh he went forward
along the narrow street which is called St. James's Walk. In a few
minutes he had reached the end of it, and found himself facing a high
grey-brick wall, wherein, at this point, was an arched gateway closed
with black doors. He looked at the gateway, then fixed his gaze on
something that stood just above---something which the dusk half
concealed, and by so doing made more impressive. It was the sculptured
counterfeit of a human face, that of a man distraught with agony. The
eyes stared wildly from their sockets, the hair straggled in maniac
disorder, the forehead was wrung with torture, the cheeks sunken, the
throat fearsomely wasted, and from the wide lips there seemed to be
issuing a {\protect\hypertarget{5}{}{}}horrible cry. Above this hideous
effigy was carved the legend: "\textsc{Middlesex House of Detention}."

Something more than pain came to the old man's face as he looked and
pondered; his lips trembled like those of one in anger, and his eyes had
a stern, resentful gleaming. He walked on a few paces, then suddenly
stopped where a woman was standing at an open door.

``I ask your pardon,'' he said, addressing her with the courtesy which
owes nothing to refined intercourse, ``but do you by chance know any one
of the name of Snowdon hereabouts?''

The woman replied with a brief negative; she smiled at the appearance of
the questioner, and, with the vulgar instinct, looked about for some one
to share her amusement.

``Better inquire at the 'ouse at the corner,'' she added, as the man was
moving away. ``They've been here a long time, I b'lieve.''

He accepted her advice. But the people {\protect\hypertarget{6}{}{}}at
the public-house could not aid his search. He thanked them, paused for a
moment with his eyes down, then again sighed slightly and went forth
into the gathering gloom.

Less than five minutes later there ran into the same house of
refreshment a little slight girl, perhaps thirteen years old; she
carried a jug, and at the bar asked for ``a pint of old six.'' The
barman, whilst drawing the ale, called out to a man who had entered
immediately after the child:

``Don't know nobody called Snowdon about 'ere, do you, Mr. Squibbs?''

The individual addressed was very dirty, very sleepy, and seemingly at
odds with mankind. He replied contemptuously with a word which, in
phonetic rendering, may perhaps be spelt ``Nay-oo.''

But the little girl was looking eagerly from one man to the other; what
had been said appeared to excite keen interest in her. She forgot all
about the beer-jug that was waiting, and, after a brief but obvious
struggle with timidity, said in an uncertain voice:

{\protect\hypertarget{7}{}{}}``Has somebody been asking for that name,
sir?''

``Yes, they have,'' the barman answered, in surprise. ``Why?''

``My name's Snowdon, sir---Jane Snowdon.''

She reddened over all her face as soon as she had given utterance to the
impulsive words. The barman was regarding her with a sort of
semi-interest, and Mr. Squibbs also had fixed his bleary (or beery) eyes
upon her. Neither would have admitted an active interest in so pale and
thin and wretchedly-clad a little mortal. Her hair hung loose, and had
no covering; it was hair of no particular colour, and seemed to have
been for a long time utterly untended; the wind, on her run hither, had
tossed it into much disorder. Signs there were of some kind of clothing
beneath the short, dirty, worn dress, but it was evidently of the
scantiest description. The freely exposed neck was very thin, but, like
the outline of her face, spoke less of a feeble habit of body than of
the present pinch of sheer hunger. She did not, indeed,
{\protect\hypertarget{8}{}{}}look like one of those children who are
born in disease and starvation and put to nurse upon the pavement; her
limbs were shapely enough, her back was straight, she had features that
were not merely human, but girl-like, and her look had in it the light
of an intelligence generally sought for in vain among the children of
the street. The blush and the way in which she hung her head were
likewise tokens of a nature endowed with ample sensitiveness.

``Oh, your name's Jane Snowdon, is it?'' said the barman. ``Well, you're
just three minutes an' three-quarters too late. P'raps it's a fortune a
runnin' after you. He was a rum old party as inquired. Never mind; it's
all in a life. There's fortunes lost every week by a good deal less than
three minutes when it's 'orses---eh, Mr. Squibbs?''

Mr. Squibbs swore with emphasis.

The little girl took her jug of beer and was turning away.

``Hollo!'' cried the barman. "Where's the money, Jane?---if \emph{you}
don't mind."

{\protect\hypertarget{9}{}{}}She turned again in increased confusion,
and laid coppers on the counter. Thereupon the man asked her where she
lived; she named a house in Clerkenwell Close, near at hand.

``Father live there?''

She shook her head.

``Mother?''

``I haven't got one, sir.''

``Who is it as you live with, then?''

``Mrs. Peckover, sir.''

``Well, as I was sayin', he was a queer old joker as arsted for the name
of Snowdon. Shouldn't wonder if you see him goin' round.''

And he added a pretty full description of this old man, to which the
girl listened closely. Then she went thoughtfully---a little sadly---on
her way.

In the street, all but dark by this time, she cast anxious glances
onwards and behind, but no old man in an odd hat and cloak and with
white hair was discoverable. Linger she might not. She reached a house
of which the front-door stood open; it looked
{\protect\hypertarget{10}{}{}}black and cavernous within, but she
advanced with the step of familiarity and went downstairs to a
front-kitchen. Through the half-open door came a strong odour and a
hissing sound, plainly due to the frying of sausages. Before Jane could
enter, she was greeted sharply in a voice which was young and that of a
female, but had no other quality of graciousness.

``You've taken your time, my lady! All right! just wait till I've `ad my
tea, that's all! Me an' you'll settle accounts to-night, see if we
don't. Mother told me as she owed you a lickin', an' I'll pay it off,
with a little on my own account too. Only wait till I've `ad my tea,
that's all. What are you standin' there for, like a fool? Bring that
beer `ere, an' let's see 'ow much you've drank.''

``I haven't put my lips near it, miss; indeed I haven't,'' pleaded the
child, whose face of dread proved both natural timidity and the constant
apprehension of ill-usage.

``Little liar! that's what you always was, an always will be.---Take
that!''

{\protect\hypertarget{11}{}{}}The speaker was a girl of sixteen, tall,
rather bony, rudely handsome; the hand with which she struck was large
and coarse-fibred, the muscles that impelled it vigorous. Her dress was
that of a work-girl, unsubstantial, ill-fitting, but of ambitious cut;
her hair was very abundant, and rose upon the back of her head in thick
coils, an elegant fringe depending in front. The fire had made her face
scarlet, and in the lamplight her large eyes glistened with many joys.

First and foremost, Miss Clementina Peckover rejoiced because she had
left work much earlier than usual, and was about to enjoy what she would
have described as a ``blow out.'' Secondly, she rejoiced because her
mother, the landlady of the house, was absent for the night, and
consequently she would exercise sole authority over the domestic slave,
Jane Snowdon, that is to say, would indulge to the uttermost her
instincts of cruelty in tormenting a defenceless creature. Finally---a
cause of happiness antecedent to {\protect\hypertarget{12}{}{}}the
others, but less vivid in her mind at this moment---in the next room lay
awaiting burial the corpse of Mrs. Peckover's mother-in-law, whose death
six days ago had plunged mother and daughter into profound delight,
partly because they were relieved at length from making pretence of
humanity to a bed-ridden old woman, partly owing to the fact that the
deceased had left behind her a sum of seventy-five pounds, exclusive of
moneys due from a burial-club.

``Ah!'' exclaimed Miss Peckover (who was affectionately known to her
intimates as ``Clem''), as she watched Jane stagger back from the blow
and hide her face in silent endurance of pain. "That's just a morsel to
stay your appetite, my lady! You didn't expect me back `ome at this
time, did you? You thought as you was goin' to `ave the kitchen to
yourself when mother went. Ha ha! ho ho!---These sausages is done; now
you clean that fiyin'-pan; and if I can find a speck of dirt in it as
big as 'arf a farden, I'll take you by the 'air of
{\protect\hypertarget{13}{}{}}the `ed an' clean it with your face,
\emph{that's} what I'll do! Understand? Oh, I mean what I say, my lady!
Me an' you's a-goin' to spend a evenin' together, there's no two ways
about that. Ho ho! he he!"

The frankness of Clem's brutality went far towards redeeming her
character. The exquisite satisfaction with which she viewed Jane's
present misery, the broad joviality with which she gloated over the
prospect of cruelties shortly to be inflicted, put her at once on a par
with the noble savage running wild in woods. Civilisation could bring no
charge against this young woman; it and she had no common criterion. Who
knows but this lust of hers for sanguinary domination was the natural
enough issue of the brutalising serfdom of her predecessors in the
family line of the Peckovers? A thrall suddenly endowed with authority
will assuredly make bitter work for the luckless creature in the next
degree of thraldom.

A cloth was already spread across one end of the deal table, with such
other {\protect\hypertarget{14}{}{}}preparations for a meal as Clem
deemed adequate. The sausages---five in number---she had emptied from
the frying-pan directly on to her plate, and with them all the black
rich juice that had exuded in the process of cooking---particularly
rich, owing to its having several times caught fire and blazed
triumphantly. On sitting down and squaring her comely frame to work, the
first thing Clem did was to take a long draught out of the beer-jug;
refreshed thus, she poured the remaining liquor into a glass. Ready at
hand was mustard, made in a tea-cup; having taken a certain quantity of
this condiment on to her knife, she proceeded to spread each sausage
with it from end to end, patting them in a friendly way as she finished
the operation. Next she sprinkled them with pepper, and after that she
constructed a little pile of salt on the side of the plate, using her
fingers to convey it from the salt-cellar. It remained to cut a thick
slice of bread---she held the loaf pressed to her bosom whilst doing
this---and {\protect\hypertarget{15}{}{}}to crush it down well into the
black grease beside the sausages; then Clem was ready to begin.

For five minutes she fed heartily, showing really remarkable skill in
conveying pieces of sausage to her mouth by means of the knife alone.
Finding it necessary to breathe at last, she looked round at Jane. The
hand-maiden was on her knees near the fire, scrubbing very hard at the
pan with successive pieces of newspaper. It was a sight to increase the
gusto of Clem's meal, but of a sudden there came into the girl's mind a
yet more delightful thought. I have mentioned that in the back-kitchen
lay the body of a dead woman; it was already encoffined, and waited for
interment on the morrow, when Mrs. Peckover would arrive with a certain
female relative from St. Albans. Now the proximity of this corpse was a
ceaseless occasion of dread and misery to Jane Snowdon; the poor child
had each night to make up a bed for herself in this front-room, dragging
together a little heap of rags when {\protect\hypertarget{16}{}{}}mother
and daughter were gone up to their chamber, and since the old woman's
death it was much if Jane had enjoyed one hour of unbroken sleep. She
endeavoured to hide these feelings, but Clem, with her Red Indian scent,
divined them accurately enough. She hit upon a good idea.

``Go into the next room,'' she commanded suddenly, ``and fetch the
matches off of the mantelpiece. I shall want to go upstairs presently,
to see if you've scrubbed the bedroom well.''

Jane was blanched; but she rose from her knees at once, and reached a
candlestick from above the fireplace. ``What's that for?'' shouted Clem,
with her mouth full. "You've no need of a light to find the mantelpiece.
If you're not off{{------}}"

Jane hastened from the kitchen. Clem yelled to her to close the door,
and she had no choice but to obey. In the dark passage outside there was
darkness that might be felt. The child all but fainted with the
{\protect\hypertarget{17}{}{}}sickness of horror as she turned the
handle of the other door and began to grope her way. She knew exactly
where the coffin was; she knew that to avoid touching it in the
diminutive room was all but impossible. And touch it she did. Her
anguish uttered itself, not in a mere sound of terror, but in a broken
word or two of a prayer she knew by heart, including a name which
sounded like a charm against evil. She had reached the mantelpiece; oh,
she could not, could not find the matches! Yes, at last her hand closed
on them. A blind rush, and she was out again in the passage. She
re-entered the front-kitchen with limbs that quivered, with the sound of
dreadful voices ringing about her, and blankness before her eyes.

Clem laughed heartily, then finished her beer in a long, enjoyable pull.
Her appetite was satisfied; the last trace of oleaginous matter had
disappeared from her plate, and now she toyed with little pieces of
bread lightly dipped into the mustard-pot. These
{\protect\hypertarget{18}{}{}}\emph{bonnes bouches} put her into
excellent humour; presently she crossed her arms and leaned back. There
was no denying that Clem was handsome; at sixteen she had all her charms
in apparent maturity, and they were of the coarsely magnificent order.
Her forehead was low and of great width; her nose was well shapen, and
had large sensual apertures; her cruel lips may be seen on certain fine
antique busts; the neck that supported her heavy head was splendidly
rounded. In laughing, she became a model for an artist, an embodiment of
fierce life independent of morality. Her health was probably less sound
than it seemed to be; one would have compared her, not to some piece of
exuberant normal vegetation, but rather to a rank, evilly-fostered
growth. The putrid soil of that nether world yields other forms besides
the obviously blighted and sapless.

``Have you done any work for Mrs. Hewett to-day?'' she asked of her
victim, after sufficiently savouring the spectacle of terror.

{\protect\hypertarget{19}{}{}}``Yes, miss; I did the front-room
fireplace, an' fetched fourteen of coals, an' washed out a few things.''

``What did she give you?''

``A penny, miss. I gave it to Mrs. Peckover before she went.''

``Oh, you did? Well, look `ere; you'll just remember in future that all
you get from the lodgers belongs to me, an' not to mother. It's a new
arrangement, understand. An' if you dare to give up a `apenny to mother,
I'll lick you till you're nothin' but a bag o' bones. Understand?''

Having on the spur of the moment devised this ingenious difficulty for
the child, who was sure to suffer in many ways from such a conflict of
authorities, Clem began to consider how she should spend her evening.
After all, Jane was too poor-spirited a victim to afford long
entertainment. Clem would have liked dealing with some one who showed
fight---some one with whom she could try savage issue in real
tooth-and-claw conflict. She had in mind a really exquisite piece
{\protect\hypertarget{20}{}{}}of cruelty, but it was a joy necessarily
postponed to a late hour of the night. In the meantime, it would perhaps
be as well to take a stroll, with a view of meeting a few friends as
they came away from the work-rooms. She was pondering the invention of
some long and hard task to be executed by Jane in her absence, when a
knocking at the house-door made itself heard. Clem at once went up to
see who the visitor was.

A woman in a long cloak and a showy bonnet stood on the step, protecting
herself with an umbrella from the bitter sleet which the wind was now
driving through the darkness. She said that she wished to see Mrs.
Hewett.

``Second-floor front,'' replied Clem in the offhand, impertinent tone
wherewith she always signified to strangers her position in the house.

The visitor regarded her with a look of lofty contempt, and, having
deliberately closed her umbrella, advanced towards the stairs. Clem drew
into the back regions for {\protect\hypertarget{21}{}{}}a few moments,
but as soon as she heard the closing of a door in the upper part of the
house, she too ascended, going on tip-toe, with a noiselessness which
indicated another side of her character. Having reached the room which
the visitor had entered, she brought her ear close to the keyhole, and
remained in that attitude for a long time---nearly twenty minutes, in
fact. Her sudden and swift return to the foot of the stairs was followed
by the descent of the woman in the showy bonnet.

``Miss Peckover!'' cried the latter when she had reached the foot of the
stairs.

``Well, what is it?'' asked Clem, seeming to come up from the kitchen.

``Will you 'ave the goodness to go an speak to Mrs. Hewett for a
hinstant?'' said the woman, with much affectation of refined speech.

``All right! I will just now, if I've time.'' The visitor tossed her
head and departed, whereupon Clem at once ran upstairs. In five minutes
she was back in the kitchen.

{\protect\hypertarget{22}{}{}}``See 'ere,'' she addressed Jane. ``You
know where Mr. Kirkwood works in St. John's Square? You've been before
now. Well, you're to go an' wait at the door till he comes out, and then
you're to tell him to come to Mrs. Hewett at wunst. Understand?---Why
ain't these tea-things all cleared away? All right! Wait till you come
back, that's all. Now be off, before I skin you alive!''

On the floor in a corner of the kitchen lay something that had once been
a girl's hat. This Jane at once snatched up and put on her head. Without
other covering, she ran forth upon her errand.
